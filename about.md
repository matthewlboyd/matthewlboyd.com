Howdy Yall! I'm an open-source enthusiast, GNU/Linux tinkerer, gardener (want a zucchini?), and half-bad carpenter. For employment, I've primarily worked as a Linux system administrator and database admin (Postgres and Mongo mainly), though I've previously been a machinist, bike mechanic, and kayak instructor.

In my non-work time, I can usually be found renovating my 100+ year old house, gardening with my toddler, or going on long bike rides (ideally on a dirt road or trail).

Thanks for reading!
